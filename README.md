# DF-mystic-manuscript-project
This was my first group project in the Digital Futures academy. This was the first time I ever used SQL and GitHub in a project. The setting of the project was that I worked for 'Data Dynamo Consultants' who gave me a project to hone my skills in data management and quality control. 

## Project Description
We were provided with a dataset from a client called 'Mystic Manuscripts' and our mission was to ensure the quality of the data before it was used for any further analysis. The following were the tasks we had to complete:
<ol>
  <li> <b>Dataset Upload:</b> 
    Firstly, we uploaded the dataset into SQL, making sure that all the columns had valid names and were of the correct data type. The SQL code is in the file 'Mystic Manuscripts Table Creation.sql'.
  </li>
  <li> <b> Error Identification and Quality Control: </b>
    We needed to identify any errors or null values in the data. We communicated the issues with the data to the stakeholders at Mystic Manuscripts (the Digital Futures instructors).
  </li>
  <li> <b> Error Correction and Quality Control Form: </b>
    Once the errors and inconsistencies in the data were identified, we corrected them and documented them in the quality control form ('Quality Control Form.docx'). We inserted SQL code to a shared file on Github to showcase the required quality control checks. We also performed a few extra quality checks ('Quality Control Extra Checks.sql').
  </li>
</ol>
